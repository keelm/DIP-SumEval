Children whose parents are overweight or obese are at higher risk for becoming obese themselves, studies have shown.
Obesity is a problem that is often shared by both parents and their children.
Children and adults alike who are obese or overweight are more likely to feel stress, and overweight children are more likely to report that their parents were often or always stressed over the past month.
All children with overweight/obese parents and at risk of becoming so themselves, should be monitored for unhealthy weight gain from birth.
