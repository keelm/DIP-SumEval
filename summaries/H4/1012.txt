Parents of private school students tend to be more involved in their children's education.
Many parents choose accredited programs so that their child is receiving the same education as other children of their age, but at their own pace.
Parents operating private schools to educate only their own children are not required to obtain city business licenses.
Many minority families are finding that homeschooling is an alternative to that of public school education (Bauman, 2001).
