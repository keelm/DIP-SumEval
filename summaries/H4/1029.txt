Parenting an adolescent is never easy, and when your teen is using or abusing drugs or alcohol, this transitional period is especially complex.
Adolescents whose parents have ongoing conversations with them about not trying drugs or alcohol are up to 50% less likely to try these substances.
Parents should ingrain in their kids the information that alcohol and drugs can be harmful before they are faced with these choices.
Studies show that kids are up to 50% less likely to get involved with substance abuse if their parent talked to them about saying no to drugs and alcohol.
