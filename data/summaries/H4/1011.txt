Children who are homeschooled would not have this motivation because most of them are educated separately.
Homeschooling parents who truly want to provide their children with a proper education will not allow their children to reach adolescence without developing a marketable skill.
Many parents do not know that they can, in fact, homeschool their children if they want to do so.
Homeschooling gives children a much greater chance of retaining their parents' values because of all the time they are spending with them.
