If your child becomes ill or has an accident during the school day, we will contact you.
Many schools even have a time when you can bring your child with you to visit.
Most schools require a set of indoor shoes and outdoor shoes - which means your child will be changing their own footwear multiple times each day.
Visiting a kindergarten class in the school in which you plan to enroll your child can also give you invaluable information.
School activities require that a child be able to focus on one thing for a time.
