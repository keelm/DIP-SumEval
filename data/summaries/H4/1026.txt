Educate and Teach Your Children of the Dangers of Inhalants Abuse The aim is to teach children to be safe, to be aware of predatory strangers, and to be self protective.
Teach your children they should never meet anyone in person that they've only communicated with online.
Teach your children how to interact safely with people they "meet" online.
Kids will always be kids, and parents should always take some responsibility in teaching their children how not to get involved in schoolyard antics such as bullying or harming others.
