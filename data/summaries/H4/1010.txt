Homeschooling parents should not need to prove they are innocent of abusing their children as a condition for freely exercising their parental rights in education.
Parents of homeschoolers are, on average, better educated than other parents  a greater percentage have college degrees  though their incomes are about the same.
"The Court has opined that the only role of parents is to help their children in the education they receive in the institutional schools." Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.
